# Front End Testing

This repo is a practice area for testing front end JavaScript code.

With this assignment, I will practice setting up a testing environment and writing unit tests for my code. By the end of the assignment, I am planning on being able to create accurate infrastructure for testing. My goal is to begin writing tests by reading existing code files and understand what is happening.

More specifically, this assignment will attempt to give me more practice utilizing Mocha, Chai, and Karma. I will install and track any dependencies, as well as set up a Karma test runner configuration file. Next, I will write a test in a spec file in the test directory. I will be sure to write tests for the two functions given. I will then fix any broken code, and be sure that all written tests pass.

The initial files were forked from Jordan Kasper and then cloned to my own repo to begin work.
